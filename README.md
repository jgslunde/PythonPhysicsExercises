A series of physics related exercises created for the introductory Python course IN1900 at the University of Oslo. They follow the progress of the book "A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python" by Hans Petter Langtangen.

## Overview
There is both a Norwegian and English version of the exercises, named "oppgaver_norsk.pdf" and "exercises_english.pdf", respectively.
